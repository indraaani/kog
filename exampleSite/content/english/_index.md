    content: Some would argue that this is due to disparity in the youth’s skill levels.
      We are here to disagree. Youngsters across the country have theoretical understanding
      of their fields, but have not been taught how to practically apply themselves.

    content: Anusha is a 25 year old Plastics Engineer. When she joined KOG, Anusha
      had just graduated but was unable to find relevant work, given her niche speciality.
      With KOG, she was able to connect with Mansi Lall, the Director of Operations
      at Ahuja Plastics Inc. With Mansi’s guidance, Anusha found herself working up
      the ranks at Ahuja Plastics. Today, she is a part of their illustrative engineering
      team.
